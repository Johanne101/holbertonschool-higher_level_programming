Welcome to the python world
===============================

**What is python?**
<p>
Python is an object-oriented, interpreted language that's easy to use, and
runs on many operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux and more.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object-oriented programming.

Python supports basic data types such as:
  * numbers
  * strings, (and more complex types like)
  * lists, and
  * dictionaries

These listed abouve can greatly simplify data processing.

Python also supports several programming paradigms, and can be used for,
**Procedural Programming, Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming**
Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted
nature, makes it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
development in many areas on most platforms.

The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in
the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical 
applications like Google Search.

And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning,
data science and artificial intelligence.

Data in Python is tsrongly typed (so attempting to add a number and a string will give an error)
but is also dynamically typed, so you're freed from worrying about variable declarations.

## Learning Objectives:

1. Why Python programming is awesome
  * Despite it's easy use, It's also a very powerful language
  * I'ts one of the 3 "official" languages at Google as an example.
2. Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python language
  * More about Guido van Rossum:
    * He was employed at Google for 7 years and the creator of Python.
    * He was also allowed to spend half of his time developing Python 
      * Even while being employed at Google.

> "Python is named after the cult comedy show
> Monty Python's Flying Circus, **(Not after the snake...!)**

* The Zen of Python, is a collection of ***19 "guiding principles"***

### How to use the Python interpreter:

<p>
The most straightforward way to start talking to Python is in an interactive
***Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)*** environment.

That simply means starting up the interpreter and typing commands to it directly

  * **R**eads the command you enter
  * **E**valuates and executes the command
  * **P**rints the output (if any) to the console
  * **L**oops back and repeats the process

One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a *UNIX* “shebang” line.
In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file.
For example:

```
  #!/usr/bin/env python3
```
</p>

* How to print text and variables using print
  * Use the print Statement to Print a Variable in Python.
  * Use a Comma , to Separate the Variables and Print Them.
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of %
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of {}
  * Use the + Operator to Separate Variables in the print Statement

```
 #Python3 code
 print('Hello to the World')
```

### Strings:

<p>
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks,
or double quotation marks.

```
print("Today is a good day to learn Python")
print('Python is fun')
print("python's strings are easy to usre")
print('We can even include "quotes" in strings')
print("concatination str1" + "concatination str2")
```
  * 'hello' is the same as "hello".
  * You can display a string literal with the print() function:

* What are indexing and slicing in Python | “Indexing”:
means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within
the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an
iterable based on their indices.
* What is the official Python coding style and
how to check your code with pycodestyle

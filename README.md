Welcome to the python world!

**What is python?**
Python is an object-oriented, interpreted language that's easy to use, and
runs on many operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux and more.

It's named after the cult comedy show...
**Monty Python's Flying Circus**
(not after the snake), and you'll find various refreces to Monty Python
sketches in the official documentation.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object-oriented programming.
Python supports basic data types such as numbers and strings, as well as
more complex types like lists and dicctionaries, that can greatly simplify
data processing.

Python also supports several programming paradigms, and can be used for,
**Procedural Programming, Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming**
Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted 
nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application 
development in many areas on most platforms.

The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in
the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical 
applications like Google Search.

And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning,
data science and artificial intelligence.

Before we continue, make sure to understand the following points:
* Who created Python | Guido Van Rossum
* Who is Guido van Rossum | is a Dutch programmer best known as the
creator of the Python programming language, for which he was the
"benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL)
until he stepped down from the position in July 2018.
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from? | It is named after a cult
comedy show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" (NOT THE SNAKE).
* What is the Zen of Python | is a collection of 19 "guiding principles"
for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python
	programming language. It is also interpreted as an
	Easter egg in the python interpreter.
* How to use the Python interpreter |  The most straightforward way to
start talking to Python is in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
environment.
That simply means starting up the interpreter and typing commands to it directly.
The interpreter:

  * Reads the command you enter
  * Evaluates and executes the command
  * Prints the output (if any) to the console
  * Loops back and repeats the process
* How to print text and variables using print | Python Print Variable
  * Use the print Statement to Print a Variable in Python.
  * Use a Comma , to Separate the Variables and Print Them.
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of %
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of {}
  * Use the + Operator to Separate Variables in the print Statement
* How to use strings | Strings
  * Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks,
  or double quotation marks.
  * 'hello' is the same as "hello".
  * You can display a string literal with the print() function:
* What are indexing and slicing in Python | “Indexing”:
means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within
the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an
iterable based on their indices.

Welcome to the python world
===============================

**Why is Python programming is awesome?**
<p>
Python 3 is a truly versatile programming language, loved by computer nerds;
web developers, data scientists, and software engineers.
There are several good reasons for that!

1. Python is open-source and has a great support community,
2. Plus, extensive support libraries.
3. Its data structures are user-friendly.

***Best of all:***

Once you get a hang of it, your development speed and productivity will soar!

If you want to master two lucrative codings skills at
once — server-side website development and machine learning — Python is your best bet.

The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in
the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical 
applications like Google Search.

And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning,
data science and artificial intelligence.

  * Despite it's easy use, It's also a very powerful language
  * I'ts one of the 3 "official" languages at Google as an example.
2. Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python language
  * More about Guido van Rossum:
    * He was employed at Google for 7 years and the creator of Python.
    * He was also allowed to spend half of his time developing Python 
      * Even while being employed at Google.


**What is python?**
<p>
Python is an object-oriented, interpreted language that's easy to use, and
runs on many operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux and more.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object-oriented programming.

Python supports basic data types such as:
  * numbers
  * strings, (and more complex types like)
  * lists, and
  * dictionaries

These listed abouve can greatly simplify data processing.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
---------------------------------------------------
* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

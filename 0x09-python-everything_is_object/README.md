=============================

REMEMBER... in the past project how everything in python is object...?
| YOUR'E WELCOME!!! ;) |
|:-----:|


## General:

Why Python programming is awesome

		Because it pays the BILL$,
		Python is very a very useful object oriented language
		that aims to combine data, and the data processes,
		that act on that data into objects!
		**INCEPTION**


-------------------------------
Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!

Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

introduction
id and type
mutable objects
immutable objects
why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects
--------------------------------


What is an object

What is the difference between a class and an object or instance

What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object

What is a reference

What is an assignment

What is an alias

How to know if two variables are identical

How to know if two variables are linked to the same object

How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)

What is mutable and immutable

What are the built-in mutable types

What are the built-in immutable types

How does Python pass variables to functions

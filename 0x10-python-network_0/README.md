# General Objectives

## URL
<p>
It is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web.
</p>

## What is HTTP??
<p>
HTTP stands for **H**yper **T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol
</p>

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
<p>
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to uniquely identify a resource over the web. URL has the following syntax:
</p>
```
protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name
```

|The 4 URL parts |Description|Example|
|:--------------:|-----------|:-----:|
|*Protocol*|<p>The application-level protocol used by the client and server.</p>|HTTP, FTP, and telnet|
|*Hostname*|<p>The DNS domain name  or IP address of the server.</p>| DNS: www.nowhere123.com/IP: 192.128.1.2|
|*Port*|<p>The TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from the clients.</p>|ports: 80,8080,443,548,etc.|
|*Path-and-file-name*|<p>The name and location of the requested resource, under the server document base directory.</p>|

**The scheme for a HTTP URL...**

## What a domain name is
<p>
A domain name is your website's equivalent of a physical address.
It helps us find your site easily instead of using its internet protocol (IP) address.

>>a bunch of numbers that we dont care.

## More to ask? Google :)

  * What a sub-domain is
  * How to define a port number in a URL
  * What a query string is
  * What an HTTP request is
  * What an HTTP response is

## What HTTP headers are

<p>
**HTTP headers** let the client and the server pass additional
information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header
consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (`:`), then
by its value.
</p>

## What the HTTP message body is

## What an HTTP request method is

|HTTP Request | <p>defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.</p>|
|:------------|-------------------------------|
|`GET`|<p>The **GET** method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.</p>|
|`HEAD`|<p>The **HEAD** method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.</p>|
|`POST`|<p>The **POST** method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</p>|
|`PUT`|<p>The **PUT** method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.</p>|
|`DELETE`|<p>The **DELETE** method deletes the specified resource.</p>|
|`CONNECT`|<p>The **CONNECT** method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.</p>
|`OPTIONS`|<p>The **OPTIONS** method describes the communication options for the target resource.</p>|
|`TRACE`|<p>The **TRACE** method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</p>|
|`PATCH`|<p>The **PATCH** method applies partial modifications to a resource.</p>|

## What an HTTP response status code is
<p>
The first line of the response message contains the response status code, which is generated by the server to indicate the outcome of the request.
The status code is a 3-digit number:
  * 1xx (Informational): Request received, server is continuing the process.
  * 2xx (Success): The request was successfully received, understood, accepted and serviced.
  * 3xx (Redirection): Further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
  * 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be understood.
  * 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
</p>

## What an HTTP Cookie is
  * Cookie in simpler terms means just the textual information about some website.
  * Cookies are automatically sent with every HTTP request (visiting a URL, submitting a form, etc.)
  * Cookies are used to send information to the server.
  * is for storing information that will only need to be used client-side (in the browser) and (typically) won’t be sent to the server.

><p>(also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies)</p>

### General Requirements
```
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (wc -l file should print 3)
All your files should end with a new line
All your files must be executable
The first line of all your bash files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
All curl commands must have the option -s (silent mode)
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
The first line of all your Python files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
```

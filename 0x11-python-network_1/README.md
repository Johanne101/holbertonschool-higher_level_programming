Requirements
---

*  All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
*  All your files should end with a new line
*  The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
*  Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
*  All files must be executable
*  The length of your files will be tested using wc
*  All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
*  Must use [`get`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get) to access to dictionary value by key
*  This code should not be executed when imported (`by using if __name__ == "__main__":`)

# General Objectives

## Python package `urllib`
<p>

**How to fetch** internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
The simplest way to use `urllib.request` is as follows:

```python3
import urllib.request
with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
   the_page = response.read()
```

HTTP is based on requests and responses
  - the client makes requests and servers send responses.
urllib.request mirrors this with a Request object which represents the HTTP request you are making.
</p>

## How to decode `urllib` body response

```python3
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Fetch's internet resources w/ the Python package urllib """
import urllib.request

with urllib.request.urlopen('https://intranet.hbtn.io/status') as response:
   html = response.read()
   print('Body response:')
```

### Response Headers


## How to use the Python package `requests`
| How to make HTTP| Requests |
|`GET` | ... |
|`POST`/`PUT`/etc | ...|



<p>

Now, to make HTTP requests in python, we can use several HTTP libraries like:

httplib
urllib
requests

### Higher-level interface

```python3
urllib.urlopen(url[, data[, proxies[, context]]])
```

</p>

<p>
Now, we have a Response object called r. We can get all the information we need from this object.

Requestsâ€™ simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request:
```
>>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data = {'key':'value'})
```
Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: **PUT, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS**? These are all just as simple:

```
>>> r = requests.put('https://httpbin.org/put', data = {'key':'value'})
>>> r = requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')
>>> r = requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')
>>> r = requests.options('https://httpbin.org/get')
```

## How to fetch JSON resources
## How to manipulate data from an external service
## Requesting GitHub credentials (username and password) Using GitHub API
<p>
* You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as password to access to your information (only read:user permission is needed)
* The first argument will be your username
* The second argument will be your password (in your case, a personal access token as password)
* You must use the package requests and sys

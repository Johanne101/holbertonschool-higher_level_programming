Hello World!!!
==================

>  One thing to get you started programming with python,
>  make sure to search and understand the following:

**General**
* Why Python programming is awesome
  1. Despite it's easy use, It's also a very powerful language
  2. I'ts one of the 3 "official" languages at Google as an example.
* Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python language
* More about Guido van Rossum:
  * He was employed at Google for 7 years and the creator of Python.
  * He was also allowed to spend half of his time developing Python 
    * Even while he was employed at Google.

***The Zen of Python*** is a collection of ***the 19*** ***"guiding principles"***
for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language.


--------------------
What is Python?
--------------------

-  Python is an object-orineted, interpreted language that make it easy for us computer nerds use.
-  It runs on many operating systems but here everything will be operated only in linux.
-  Python supports basic data types such as:
    * number
    * strings, (and more complex types like)
    * lists, and
    * dictionaries
<p>
These can greatly simplify data processing.

Python also supports several programming paradigms, and can be used for
***Procedural Programming, Functional Programming, and Object Oriented Programming.***

> **Fun Fact**:
> 
> "Python is named after the cult comedy show
> Monty Python's Flying Circus,(Not after the snake...!)
> 
> and you can find multiple references to Monty Python in the official documentation."

### Strings:
<p>

* How to print text and variables using print
  * Use the print Statement to Print a Variable in Python.
  * Use a Comma , to Separate the Variables and Print Them.
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of %
  * Use the String Formatting With the Help of {}
  * Use the + Operator to Separate Variables in the print Statement

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks,
or double quotation marks.

```
print("Today is a good day to learn Python")
print('Python is fun')
print("python's strings are easy to usre")
print('We can even include "quotes" in strings')
print("concatination str1" + "concatination str2")
```
  * 'hello' is the same as "hello".
  * You can display a string literal with the print() function:
</p>
### Variables and Types:
<p>
There are a few rules for variable names:
  * variable names must start with either **UPPER** or **lower** case, or an underscore_chacaracter.
  * They contain letters, numbers or underscore characters (but cannot begin with a number).
  * Python variables are case sensitive, so **greeting** and **Greeting** would refer to 2 different variables.
  * Variables are created when they are first attached to a value, using`=`.

* What are indexing and slicing in Python | “Indexing”:
means referring to an element of an iterable by its position within
the iterable. “Slicing” means getting a subset of elements from an
iterable based on their indices.
* What is the official Python coding style and
how to check your code with pycodestyle
